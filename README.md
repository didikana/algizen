# algizen
ALGi-zen is a computational sustainability project that models microalgae-based façade panels for carbon capture and biostimulant reuse. The system simulates photosynthetic efficiency, CO₂ absorption, and light diffusion using coupled differential equations and real-time sensor feedback from a custom photoreactor.
