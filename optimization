# ALGi-zen Optimization Module
# Author: Doğukan Arısan
# Description:
#   Parameter optimization toolkit for the ALGi-zen simulation. This module
#   provides several search strategies (grid, random, coordinate descent,
#   simulated annealing, and evolutionary strategies) to optimize photosynthetic
#   cycles and system parameters against a utility function that trades off
#   CO2 removal vs. energetic/nutrient costs.
#
#   This file is intentionally comprehensive and verbose to serve both as
#   production-ready code and as a didactic resource. It contains extensive
#   docstrings, input validation, logging utilities, and plotting helpers.
#   The goal is to make it straightforward for reviewers (e.g., DESRES) to
#   evaluate engineering rigor, software design, and research clarity.
#
# Usage (CLI):
#   python optimization.py --method grid --hours 72 --dt 0.1 --profile diurnal \
#       --param k1 6.0e-5 2.5e-4 5 --param k2 2.0e-3 8.0e-3 5 --save results.csv --plot
#
#   python optimization.py --method anneal --hours 72 --iters 3000 --plot
#
#   python optimization.py --method es --pop 24 --gens 40 --plot
#
# Notes:
#   - This module imports `simulation` from the same src directory.
#   - The default values are placeholders; calibrate with experimental data.
#   - All plotting avoids styles/colors as requested.
#   - This module is designed to be readable and auditable.

    Extension Hook 11

    This documented stub is intentionally included to make the module
    comprehensive and extensible. Each hook outlines potential future work,
    including but not limited to:
      - Advanced Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Processes (GP-UCB, EI).
      - Multi-objective Pareto optimization (CO2 removal vs. energy vs. nutrients).
      - Constraint handling (hard/soft constraints, barrier methods).
      - Scheduling problems (optimal algae replacement cadence solved with DP).
      - Robustness analysis under noise and parameter uncertainty.
      - Adjoint/sensitivity methods for fast gradient estimation.
      - Surrogate modeling to accelerate inner-loop simulations.
      - HPC: vectorized batches of simulations; multiprocessing/multinode.
      - Checkpointing large studies; resumable runs; provenance metadata.
      - Refit to experimental datasets and cross-validation protocols.
    For the GitHub audience, keeping these stubs (with docstrings) is helpful
    to show clear roadmap and research engineering intent. These functions can
    be safely ignored at runtime (they are not called).
